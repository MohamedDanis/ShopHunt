## Shop Hunt
### Description
When we require a specific product, our typical approach is to visit our nearest store and check its availability. If the product is not available at that store, we would then go to another store where it might be in stock. This process can be time-consuming. You might suggest looking for the product on platforms like Amazon or Flipkart, but what if the product is an essential one that we need immediately? In such cases, we have to rely on local stores. However, repeatedly going in and out of multiple shops can be a time-consuming process. I need to develop an application where users can search for a specific product and receive notifications if the product is available in nearby shops.
